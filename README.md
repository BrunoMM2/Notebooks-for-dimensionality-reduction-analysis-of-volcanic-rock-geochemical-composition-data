# Notebooks-for-dimensionality-reduction-analysis-of-volcanic-rock-geochemical-composition-data

In this project we are going to analyse the volcanics rocks using its geochemical composition data, and for that we are going to use a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), a
dimensionality reduction method, and a clustering algorithm, Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)
