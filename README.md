# Topological-stratification-of-volcanic-rocks

In this project we are going to use all the information of the chemical volcanic analysis, and for that we are going to use a uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)[16], a
dimensionality reduction method, and a clustering algorithm, Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN)
